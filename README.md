# Waser-Wurret
This was a project for my Mechatronics &amp; IoT class in which my partner and I developed and IoT laser turret that competed in a class competition. Our challenge was to design the hardware and software for a fully autonomous lasser turret that could hit targets at specific coordinates accurately with a laser diode beam.
